# File Metadata Microservice

This is project #5 of the freeCodeCamp Backend Development Certification Syllabus.
It is the last of the microservice projects.

## Objective

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <https://aryanj-file-size.herokuapp.com/> and deploy it to Glitch.

Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project.
If you can't remember how to do this revisit <https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects>.

## User Stories

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

  * I can submit a FormData object that includes a file upload.
  * I will receive the file size in bytes in the JSON response.

## Pro Tip

You may want to use this package: <https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer>.

## On Completion

Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
